I am a Principal User Researcher at Autodesk. My research work focuses on human-computer interaction. I have a background in Psychology and I am knowledgable in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. I previously was a postdoctoral/data scientist researcher at Stanford University and I earned my Ph.D. degree in Experimental Psychology at University of Ottawa. I am passionate about applying my user experience research skills to help product teams design human-centered products and systems that empower users with different backgrounds and needs.
