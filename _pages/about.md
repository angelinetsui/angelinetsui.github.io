I am a postdoctoral scholar working with Michael C. Frank at Stanford University. My primary research focuses on bilingual infant word learning. I study (i) how young bilingual learners handle the demands of learning two languages in their environments and (ii) whether bilinguals and monolinguals differ in language development and what may drive the difference. More recently, I focus on the use of large-scale, multi-site studies to examine key infancy research findings can be generalized to different populations. I also have a strong interest in advancing infancy research by open sciences and best research practice (e.g., best use of statistical methods in analysis).
