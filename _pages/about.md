I am a user research data scientist at Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd. I previously was a postdoctoral researcher working with Michael C. Frank at Stanford University. I am passionate about applying data science approach (e.g., large-scale data approach) in studying important question in the world, for example developing a system that uses machine learning algorithm to track user experience across different products.
