**Project Overview**

With the advancement in AI technology, users often make decisions based on predictions suggested by the AI systems. However, the underlying models that produces AI system predictions to users are often opaque (also known as black-box model) and can contain flaws (e.g., bias in data set and prediction), thus leading to possible undesirable decisions made by users (e.g., unfair decisions). Thus, it is important to ensure AI technology and systems are trustworthy in the whole AI lifecycle, from the early design stage, development, deployment to final use. 

In this project, I developed and led a AI design-thinking workshop that helped designers, engineers and product managers to understand how to identify user needs and potential AI features that users want. I created design-thinking activities that educate people who do not have technical background to understand what AI need and interact with users, thus supporting the product teams to integrate user' perspectives in designing a AI features that users trust and willing to adopt.
